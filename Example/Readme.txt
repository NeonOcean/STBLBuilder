The 'Build' batch file will output the STBL files to a folder named 'output'.
The 'Build-PackageBuilder' batch file will do the same but will create source info files for use with NeonOcean's package builder tool.

Batch files aren't vital for the use of STBL builder, it can be as simple as dragging and dropping the XML file onto the Builder executable.
